I&rsquo;m currently a software developer at Microsoft working on Azure Traffic Manager.
In 2017 and 2018, I spent time interning (and competing in lots of puzzle and coding challenges) at Bloomberg, LP.
I got a couple B.Sc.s from Virginia Tech (one in math and one in computer science) in 2018.
I&rsquo;ve spent time helping out at VTHacks (PR/organizing for the event) and VTHunt (making the site for the puzzle hunt)."/>

<p>I got a couple B.Sc.s from <a href="vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a> (one in math and one in computer science) in 2018.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent time helping out at <a href="https://vthacks.com/">VTHacks</a> (PR/organizing for the event) and <a href="https://www.vthunt.com/">VTHunt</a> (making the site for the puzzle hunt).</p>

<p>This is my personal site! I&rsquo;ll be posting miscellaneous projects, work, art, writing, and ramblings - mostly for my own</p>
<p>, I&rsquo;m Sam. I&rsquo;m a theme for <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. I&rsquo;m an extremely customizable, content-focused theme that lets you showcase your work your way.</p>
<p>I have slick minimalist templates for list pages (such as a list of blog posts) and single pages (a page to read one blog post). You can use tags on your content, and view content by tags.</p>
<p>I also have a simple responsive gallery built with CSS grid. It&rsquo;ll look great on any screen, and all you have to do is provide a folder of images.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m built and maintained by <a href="https://victoria.dev">Victoria Drake</a>. Here&rsquo;s her <a href="https://github.com/victoriadrake">GitHub</a>.</p>
